# ChooseYourOwnAdventure
This is a simple choose your own adventure code in python, im sure you can fork it and make it into a longer one, or different if you want. go nuts
it works with simple if and else statements and the input command.  i left a fstring at the top so you can change it to your name




To run this script, simply open a terminal and then type "python3" and then a space followed by the path to the file. I know in macs you can just drag the file into terminal and it will paste in its pathname.
